### Talk 1 - Data analysis with Jupyter, Pandas, DuckDB and maps

*Saturday 10am* - This session will introduce you to using Pandas (a Python library), DuckDB, and Jupyter Notebook for data analysis. You will learn how to manipulate and effectively work with a dataset while also discovering how to generate maps.

### Talk 2 - Data pipelines in production with Airflow

*Saturday 2pm* - During this second session, we will leverage the power of Apache Airflow to transform the previously created notebooks into data pipelines.
